# 📊 Real-Time AUX Status Governance Dashboard

## 🚀 Overview

The **Real-Time AUX Status Governance Dashboard** is a web-based internal monitoring tool built to track AUX (Auxiliary) status compliance across multiple operational regions. Designed specifically for large-scale logistics environments, the dashboard helps ensure workforce adherence by identifying anomalies and surfacing real-time insights that were previously only available through manual tracking.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

In high-paced operational environments such as Amazon’s transportation network, agent AUX statuses (representing availability and activity states) are critical for performance, compliance, and productivity. However, there was:

- **No centralized tool** to monitor these statuses in real time.
- **Delayed detection** of misuse or long idle periods (e.g., AUX 5 misused).
- **Manual efforts** to compile and review AUX compliance reports.
- **Lack of visibility** across regional teams and shift timelines.

These gaps led to SLA violations, inefficiencies, and reduced accountability.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Create a **real-time, automated AUX governance dashboard** that:

- Monitors AUX statuses live across multiple regions.
- Detects and flags anomalies or non-compliant behavior (e.g., idle time violations).
- Automates alerts and escalations to regional managers.
- Presents a clean, interactive UI for stakeholders.
- Reduces manual effort and improves adherence tracking.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🔁 **Real-time Monitoring**: Live tracking of AUX status changes across operational agents.
- ⚠️ **Anomaly Detection**: Rules-based logic to flag AUX misuse, long idle periods, or improper transitions.
- 📢 **Automated Alerts**: Instant alerts triggered using internal notification systems for proactive resolution.
- 📊 **Dashboard UI**: Interactive JavaScript-based frontend with sorting, filtering, and highlighting.
- 🤖 **GenAI Integration**: JavaScript logic for frontend automation was developed and refined using **ChatGPT** to enhance development speed and accuracy.
